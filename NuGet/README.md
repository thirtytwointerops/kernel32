# ThirtyTwo - Kernel32

We interoperate all Kernel32 methods, structures, and enumerations from the Windows API to the .NET Framework following [official Microsoft documentation][url_microsoft_docs].

> **IMPORTANT:** some methods may not work correctly, as they were designed for use in the **C++** environment, we suggest that, if there are alternative and more reliable means for a given objective, use them.
