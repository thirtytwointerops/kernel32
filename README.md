## ðŸ“˜ Get Started

The [Kernel32](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ThirtyTwo.Kernel32/), developed by a community specialized in the interoperability of Windows APIs, enables the use of all functions available in the Kernel32 API. It offers meticulously organized and named structures and enumerations, all based on [official Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-reference).

## ðŸ“‘ Documentation

At [ThirtyTwo Interops](https://github.com/thirtytwointerops), our mission is to review and enhance Microsoftâ€™s official documentation by correcting incomplete, incorrect, or outdated information. This repository now includes the [Wiki section](https://github.com/thirtytwointerops/kernel32/wiki), which contains the official documentation for the [Kernel32](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ThirtyTwo.Kernel32/) library. Changes may occur over time.

## ðŸ“¦ Create the NuGet Package

All libraries associated with the .NET Framework come with a pre-configured **`.nuspec`** file intended for package creation. To ensure the safety of developers, we have consolidated all necessary commands into a single **Batch** file.

For the packaging process, it is imperative that the following tools are installed on the Microsoft Windows operating system:

- [.NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/pt-br/download/dotnet-framework), required for project compilation.
- [cURL](https://curl.se/download.html), used for downloading external dependencies.

If all dependencies are properly installed, the following command should be executed from the root directory of the project. The package will be generated within the **NuGet** directory:

```bash
.\pack # or
.\pack.bat
```
