The library comes with the pre-configured `.nuspec` file for creating the [Nuget][url_nuget] package, with only the need to change the package information.

To create your package, follow these steps:

- On Microsoft Windows, install the recent [NuGet CLI][url_nuget_cli] version.
- Open the project in [Visual Studio][url_visual_studio] and compile in `Release` mode
- Download and copy the `nuget.exe` file into the `NuGet` folder.
- Run the `nuget pack` command.

If you have [cURL][url_curl] installed, after compiling the project, run the command:

```bash
curl -o "NuGet/nuget.exe" "https://dist.nuget.org/win-x86-commandline/latest/nuget.exe"
cd NuGet
./nuget pack
```
